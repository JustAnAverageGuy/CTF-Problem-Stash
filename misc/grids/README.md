## Description
GIFs are fun...what do you say?

btw left-right-top-bottom is the key

## Writeup
Separate out the frames of the gif

Black represents 1 and white represents 0

Start building a string by going left to right and then top to bottom

You will get a binary string that decodes to the flag

## FLAG
COPS{0_4nd_1}
