# YouThrilled? (MEDIUM)

## Description

Ever carefully observed the URLs of videos we watch daily..?
```unique video identifier : ZQs0StWBzZ4```


## Writeup
Find the youtube video using the video identifier and check out the description which leads to the about section and then the comments.
You will realise that you need to look at the complete picture of the channel banner (not the cropped one).
You can view the flag once the cropping is removed (for reference:``` https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/91659/how-to-view-the-full-background-image-of-a-youtube-channel ```)

## FLAG
